## Project Description

This project allows users to upload images of ingredients and receive recipe suggestions based on those ingredients. It utilizes Google Vision AI for ingredient detection and TheMealDB for recipe retrieval.

**Key Features:**

* **Image-based Ingredient Detection:** Upload images of ingredients, and the application will attempt to identify them.
* **Recipe Suggestions:** Based on the detected ingredients, the application will provide recipe suggestions from TheMealDB.
* **Local Hosting:** This application is currently designed to be hosted and run locally.

**Important Notes:**

1.  **Local Hosting Only:** At this time, this project can only be hosted and run on a local machine.
2.  **Free API Usage:** There are no restrictions on the number of API calls you can make. The application relies on Google Vision AI (for ingredient detection) and TheMealDB (for recipe data), both of which offer generous free tiers.
3.  **Ingredient Detection Accuracy:** Please be aware that the ingredient detection AI is not perfect. It may occasionally misidentify ingredients, which can lead to irrelevant recipe suggestions. This is a current limitation of the project.

**Technologies Used:**

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Google Cloud Vision API
* TheMealDB API

**Future Improvements:**

* Improve ingredient detection accuracy.
* Deploy the application for public access.
* Add more recipe filtering options.
* Enhance the user interface.
